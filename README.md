# FASTA GC Content & Length Calculator

This tool computes the length and GC content of sequences in a FASTA or multi-FASTA file.

## Features

- Python script using Biopython
- Bash wrapper for easy CLI usage
- Dockerized for portability
- GitHub-ready structure

## Usage

### Locally


./run_len_gc.sh input.fasta

# uORF Extractor from Mfannot Output

This tool extracts upstream open reading frames (uORFs) from annotated mitochondrial genome files generated by Mfannot.

## Features

- Parses Mfannot output to identify and extract uORFs
- Handles both forward and reverse strand sequences
- Outputs uORFs in FASTA format
- Includes Bash and Docker support for automation and portability

## Usage

### Locally


./run_uorf_extractor.sh path/to/mfannot_output.new

# Genic Region Length Calculator

This tool calculates the total genic/coding region length of mitochondrial genomes from coordinate files, excluding overlapping regions.

## Features

- Parses genomic coordinate files (BED-like format)
- Computes total non-overlapping genic region length
- Supports batch processing of multiple files
- Includes Bash and Docker support for automation and portability

## Usage

### Locally


mkdir -p input output
# Place your coordinate files in the 'input' folder
./run_genic_calc.sh
